  <p>I am a graduate student in the University of Wisconsin-Madison iSchool.
  I currently live in Iowa City and am taking graduate courses online in pursuit of an MLIS degree. While in school, I am also working at an off-site storage
  facility for the University of Iowa driving around a forklift and honking at people all day. My tech hero is <a href="merritt-kopas.html">merritt k</a>
  and video game technology is my favorite kind of tech. I've been playing <i>Pikmin 2</i> in my down time. I'm looking forward to learning
  more about coding and CSS especially in this class.</p>

  <h1>Completing Assignment #1</h1>

  <p>Working on Assignment #1 was fairly easy for us. We used Skype to record our conversation using the integrated video capture capabilities.
  We got chatting away about various things (including AI in <i>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</i>) so we went over the allotted time for the assignment.
  Using Adobe Premier Pro, we were able to cut down our video and get it closer to the 7 minute mark. Getting to know each other was great
  and we look forward to chatting more on the discussion boards during the semester!</p>
